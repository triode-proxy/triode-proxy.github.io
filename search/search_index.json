It answers its own IP addresses to DNS A or AAAA record queries if those domains are configured to handle, otherwise it transfers the queries to upstream name server and keeps the original answers as is. Triode uses TLS certificates automatically issued by its own self-signed CA for HTTPS connections. Motivation Since standard HTTP proxy handles all requests, higher throughput and much RAMs are required for debugging high traffic sites, such as video streaming, even if we want to watch text requests. Triode can control what requests should be proxied on a per-doamin basis, using DNS technology. It reduces bulk of traffic, and works with less RAM usage.
